::MapReduce::

Algorithms in MapReduce using Python MapReduce Framework

Implementing MapReduce algorithms for a variety of common data processing tasks. Small datasets have been used to test the code. I have utilized python library called MapReduce.py that implements the MapReduce programming model. The framework faithfully implements the MapReduce programming model, but it executes entirely on a single machine -- it does not involve parallel computation.

Python version: Python3.4
